# COATL-RADAR

2025 ECE 412/413 COATL-RADAR PROJECT

Green Coffee Bean Moisture Content Detection Using 60GHz Radar Module

# Team:
Chris Kane-Pardy

Kamal Smith

Henry Sanders

Wallace Mckenzie

# Software:

## A121 Binary File

Acconeer Provided File for Flashing Firmware to New XE125 EVK Radar Module

## A121 Exploration Tool Connection

Initial Test Programs to Interface with Acconeer A121 Exploration Tool Through Python

## Data Collection

### Consistency Testing

After Deciding Against Calculating Permittivity, We Created These Programs, Which Attempted to Mitigate Inconsistencies in Results due to Bean Geometries

### Datasets

Collected Datasets for Use in Machine Learning

### Permittivity Calculations

Original Test Programs, Which Aimed to Determined Moisture Content by First Calculating Permittivity from Acconeer "IQ" Data

### FullAverageScan (Green Coffee)

Final Program Version Which Utilizes Several Averages and Captures the Entire Waveform of the IQ Data Scan

### FullAverageScan (Roasted Coffee)

Final Program Version With Modified Settings Aimed at using Ground Roasted Coffee

## Machine Learning

### Preliminary Testing

Original Exploratory Machine Learning Programs

### Experimentation Variants

3 Separate Versions of the Base Machine Learning Program (Chris, Kamal, & Henry), Which We Used to Test and Compare Accuracy Across Different Settings

### Final Machine Learning Program with Live Testing

The Final Version of Our Machine Learning Program

## Stepper Motor

Outdated Programs for Interfacing ESP32 to Stepper Motor Using I2C for Bean Rotation
